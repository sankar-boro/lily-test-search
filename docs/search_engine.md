Yes, there are several algorithms used to store text values when a user submits a request. One common approach is to use an inverted index, which is a data structure that stores a mapping of terms or keywords to the documents or web pages where they appear. When a user submits a search query, the search engine can use the inverted index to quickly retrieve a list of documents that contain the keywords in the query.

Another approach is to use a term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm, which calculates a score for each term in a document based on how frequently it appears in the document and how often it appears in the corpus of documents as a whole. This can help the search engine to rank search results based on their relevance to the user's query.

Other algorithms and techniques used in search engines include vector space models, latent semantic analysis, and machine learning algorithms such as neural networks and decision trees. The choice of algorithm and technique depends on various factors such as the size and complexity of the corpus, the type of data being indexed, and the specific requirements of the search engine.
